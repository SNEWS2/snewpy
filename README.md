SNEWPY is a Python package for working with supernova neutrinos. It offers …

* … a simple and unified interface to hundreds of supernova simulations.
* … a large library of flavor transformations that relate neutrino fluxes produced in the supernova to those reaching a detector on Earth.
* … and a Python interface to SNOwGLoBES which lets you estimate and plot event rates in many different neutrino detectors.


## Installation

Run `pip install snewpy` to install SNEWPY.

SNEWPY includes a large number of supernova models from different simulation groups. Since these models have a size of several 100 MB, they are not included in the initial install but will be downloaded automatically when needed.
Alternatively, you can run the following command to explicitly download models you want to use to a subdirectory named `SNEWPY-models/<model_name>/` in the current directory:

`python -c 'import snewpy; snewpy.get_models()'`


## Usage and Documentation

SNEWPY gives you easy access to hundreds of included SN simulations …
```Python
import astropy.units as u
from snewpy.models.ccsn import Nakazato_2013, Bollig_2016

# Initialise two SN models. This automatically downloads the required data files if necessary.
nakazato = Nakazato_2013(progenitor_mass=20*u.solMass, revival_time=100*u.ms, metallicity=0.004, eos='shen')
bollig = Bollig_2016(progenitor_mass=27*u.solMass)
```

… and many flavor transformations that neutrinos could experience on the way to Earth …
```Python
from snewpy.flavor_transformations import AdiabaticMSW
from snewpy.neutrino import MassHierarchy

# Adiabatic MSW flavor transformation with normal mass ordering
msw_nmo = AdiabaticMSW(mh=MassHierarchy.NORMAL)
```

… letting you quickly calculate the neutrino flux reaching Earth:
```Python
# Assume a SN at the fiducial distance of 10 kpc and normal mass ordering.
flux = bollig.get_flux(distance=10*u.kpc, transformation=msw_nmo)
```

You can also calculate the observed event rate in all neutrino detectors supported by SNOwGLoBES, use the included SN models and flavor transformations in event generators like sntools, and much more.

Jupyter notebooks showcasing the downloadable supernova models available through SNEWPY and much of its functionality are available in the `doc/nb/` subfolder.
Additional example scripts are in the
`python/snewpy/scripts/` subfolder.

Papers describing SNEWPY and the underlying physics are published in the Astrophysical Journal ([DOI:10.3847/1538-4357/ac350f](https://dx.doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/ac350f), [arXiv:2109.08188](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.08188)) and the Journal of Open Source Software ([DOI:10.21105/joss.03772](https://dx.doi.org/10.21105/joss.03772)).
