Using SNEWPy as a Front End for SNOwGLoBES
==========================================

.. warning::

   This page summarizes the steps of using SNEWPy as a front end for SNOwGLoBES. Some TODOs:

   * Expand introduction/explanations
   * Should we include installation instructions or simply refer to (SNOw)GLoBES documentation? (See https://github.com/SNEWS2/snewpy/issues/26)
   * Most of the documentation on this page is currently auto-generated from docstrings, but they are incomplete for these modules.
   * Check and potentially expand existing docstrings (e.g. ``tstart`` in ``generate_fluence`` can also be a list).


Install SNOwGLoBES
------------------
Important parts of SNEWPyâ€™s functionality require the `SNOwGLoBES <https://github.com/SNOwGLoBES/snowglobes>`_ and
`GLoBES <https://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/personalhomes/globes/>`_ libraries, which need to be installed separately.
