Using SNEWPy as a Front End for SNOwGLoBES
==========================================


Install SNOwGLoBES
------------------
Important parts of SNEWPyâ€™s functionality require the `SNOwGLoBES <https://github.com/SNOwGLoBES/snowglobes>`_ and
`GLoBES <https://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/personalhomes/globes/>`_ libraries, which need to be installed separately.

.. warning::

   Should we include installation instructions or simply refer to (SNOw)GLoBES documentation? (See https://github.com/SNEWS2/snewpy/issues/26)
