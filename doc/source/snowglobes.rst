Using SNEWPy as a Front End for SNOwGLoBES
==========================================

.. warning::

   This page summarizes the steps of using SNEWPy as a front end for SNOwGLoBES. Some TODOs:

   * Add some introduction/explanations
   * Most of the documentation on this page is currently auto-generated from docstrings, but they are incomplete for these modules.


Install SNOwGLoBES
------------------
Important parts of SNEWPyâ€™s functionality require the `SNOwGLoBES <https://github.com/SNOwGLoBES/snowglobes>`_ and
`GLoBES <https://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/personalhomes/globes/>`_ libraries, which need to be installed separately.

.. warning::

   Should we include installation instructions or simply refer to their respective documentation?
   See https://github.com/SNEWS2/snewpy/issues/26
