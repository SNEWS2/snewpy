Welcome to SNEWPY!
==================

SNEWPY is a Python package for working with supernova neutrinos. It offers …

* … a simple and unified interface to hundreds of supernova simulations.
* … a large library of flavor transformations that relate neutrino fluxes
  produced in the supernova to those reaching a detector on Earth.
* … and a Python interface to SNOwGLoBES which lets you estimate and plot event
  rates in many different neutrino detectors.
