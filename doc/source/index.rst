Welcome to SNEWPY!
==================

SNEWPY is a Python package for working with supernova neutrinos. It offers …

* … a simple and unified interface to hundreds of supernova simulations.
* … a large library of flavor transformations that relate neutrino fluxes
  produced in the supernova to those reaching a detector on Earth.
* … and a Python interface to SNOwGLoBES which lets you estimate and plot event
  rates in many different neutrino detectors.

This documentation describes SNEWPY’s API. For descriptions of the underlying
physics, please see the paper `arXiv:2109.08188 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.08188>`_.
