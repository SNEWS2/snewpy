# Summary

Current neutrino detectors will observe hundreds to thousands of neutrinos
from a Galactic supernova, and future detectors will increase the yield by
an order of magnitude or more. With such neutrino data sets, the next
Galactic supernova will significantly increase our understanding of the
explosions of massive stars, nuclear physics under extreme conditions, and
the fundamental properties of neutrinos. However there is a large gulf
between supernova simulations and the corresponding signals in detectors,
making comparisons between theory and observation, as well as between
different detectors, very difficult. The SNEWPY code connects supernova
simulations with the SNOwGLoBES software [@SNOwGLoBES], allowing users to
easily calculate expected event rates from many supernova models in many
different neutrino detectors. 

# Statement of need

SNEWPY is an open-source software package which bridges the gap between
simulations of supernova neutrinos and the corresponding signals (neutrino
events) one would expect from neutrino detectors here on Earth. The package,
written in Python, is built upon numpy [@vanderWalt:2011bqk] and scipy
[@Virtanen:2019joe], and makes use of astropy [@Astropy:2013muo;
@Price-Whelan:2018hus] for astronomical transformations, model I/O, and unit
conversions.

SNEWPY provides a number of functions that together form a complete
simulation pipeline.  The software is able to interface with supernova
simulation data sets to extract the neutrino emission as a function of time,
energy, angle, and neutrino flavor from the proto-neutron star. It then
convolves the neutrino spectra with a prescription for neutrino flavor
transformation through the mantle of the star. Using the SNOwGLoBES data
format, it then generates either a time series of neutrino spectra at Earth
- the neutrinocurve - or the spectral fluence. SNEWPY is also able to
interface with SNOwGLoBES itself, and can run the neutrinocurve or fluence
data files through all the different neutrino detector models available in
SNOwGLoBES to compute expected event rates.  SNEWPY will then collate the
output from SNOwGLoBES into a signal data file per detector per signal.
Finally, SNEWPY is easily integrated into other software, such as the
supernova event generator sntools [@Migenda2021], which recently
incorporated SNEWPY as a dependency to provide access to a broad range of
supernova models and flavor transformations.

In addition to the source code, SNEWPY comes with data from several hundred
simulations kindly provided by various modeling groups, a script for
generating a spectral fluence from an analytic prescription, and several
Jupyter notebooks illustrating its capabilities. While SNEWPY has been
developed explicitly for the SuperNova Early Warning System, SNEWS 2.0
[@SNEWS:2020tbu], its object-oriented design makes the addition of new
supernova models and flavor transformations straightforward. We expect it
will prove broadly useful to modelers and theorists interested in what
neutrino detectors will observe from a supernova simulation, as well as
experimentalists wishing to evaluate the sensitivity of their detector to
supernova neutrinos.
