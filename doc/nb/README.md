# SNEWPY Usage Examples

The Jupyter notebooks in this directory contain different examples for how to use SNEWPY.

## `ccsn` and `presn` Directories

These directories contain notebooks demonstrating how to use the core-collapse and pre-supernova models available through SNEWPY.

## AnalyticFluence

This notebook demonstrates how to use the `Analytic3Species` class from `snewpy.models` to create an analytic supernova model by specifying the luminosity, mean energy and mean squared energy for three neutrino flavors.

## FlavorTransformation

This notebook demonstrates the flavor transformations available in `snewpy.flavor_transformation`. It was used to produce many of the figures in the SNEWPY ApJ paper.

## SNOwGLoBES_models

This notebook demonstrates how to use the `SNOwGLoBES` class in `snewpy.models`, which can be used with the `Type_Ia` and `PISN` model files that are available for download through SNEWPY.

## SNOwGLoBES_usage

This notebook demonstrates how to use SNEWPY’s `snewpy.snowglobes` module to interact with SNOwGLoBES.
