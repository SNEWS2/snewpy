The files in this folder are for Type Pair Instability Supernova models. 

The models are described in "Neutrino signal from pair-instability supernovae "

There are two different progenitors, P150 and P250, and the neutrino spectra are computed using two different Equations of State. 
These EOS's radically change the weak neutrino emission but not the thermal. 

There is only one line of sight into each model. Both mass orderings are considered plus the no-oscilaltion case. 

The format of each file is the SNOwBLoBES format.
