CCSN neutrino models from the MPA Garching CCSN archive based on the paper by Sukhbold et al., 2015. The archive is available on
[their website](https://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/ccsnarchive/data/SEWBJ_2015/index.html), but the data are private and available only upon request.
Note these are the results using the PROMETHEUS-VERTEX code https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002A%26A...396..361R/abstract. 
The four models are also described in Appendix C of this paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.04728
