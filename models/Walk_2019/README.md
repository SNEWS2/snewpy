Data taken from the [Garching Supernova archive](https://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/ccsnarchive/data/Walk2019/) for 40Msun progenitor, with permission to use them within snewpy.

Here we indicate the angles (theta,phi) for the different directions with respect to the SASI sloshing used in the paper, for 2 progenitor massses, for which the data are available:

40Msun
Direction 1: (1.553, 0.9817)
Direction 2: (2.9452, 0.51766)
Direction 3: (2.0528, -0.33916)

75Msun
Strong Modulations: (2.5946, -1.5568) dir1
Weak Modulations: (1.2202, -0.46282)  dir2
