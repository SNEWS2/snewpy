Data from "Constraining properties of the next nearby core-collapse supernova with multi-messenger signals: multi-messenger signals" by Warren, MacKenzie; Couch, Sean; O'Connor, Evan; Morozova, Viktoriya

1D FLASH simulations with STIR, for alpha_lambda = 1.23, 1.25, and 1.27.  Run with SFHo EOS, M1 with 12 energy groups.

For more information on these simulations, see Warren, Couch, O'Connor, & Morozova (arXiv:1912.03328) and Couch, Warren, & O'Connor (2020).

Includes the multi-messenger data from the STIR simulations.  The filename indicates the turbulent mixing parameter a and progenitor mass m of the simulation.  Columns are time [s], shock radius [cm], explosion energy [ergs], electron neutrino mean energy [MeV], electron neutrino rms energy [MeV], electron neutrino luminosity [10^51 ergs/s], electron antineutrino mean energy [MeV], electron antineutrino rms energy [MeV], electron antineutrino luminosity [10^51 ergs/s], x neutrino mean energy [MeV], x neutrino rms energy [MeV], x neutrino luminosity [10^51 ergs/s], gravitational wave frequency from eigenmode analysis of the protoneutron star structure [Hz].  Note that the x neutrino luminosity is for one neutrino flavor - to get the total mu/tau neutrino and antineutrino luminosities requires multiplying this number by 4.
