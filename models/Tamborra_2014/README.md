Data from I. Tamborra, G. Raffelt, F. Hanke, H.-T. Janka, and B. Mueller *Neutrino emission characteristics and detection opportunities based on three-dimensional supernova simulations*, [Phys. Rev. D 90:045032, 2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.0006).

Files taken from the [Garching Supernova archive](http://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/ccsnarchive/data/Tamborra2014/) for 11, 20 and 27 Msun, with permission to include them into snewpy.

NOTE: same file format as for Bollig_2016 models.

- For 11 and 20 Msun, the directions were not stored
- For 27Msun, the directions [1,2,3] correspond to the violet, black and blue directions in the paper, repectively. The violet direction (dir1) shows the enhanced SASI.
