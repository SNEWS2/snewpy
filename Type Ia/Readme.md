The files in this folder are for two Type Ia models 

The DDT model is described in
"Neutrinos from type Ia supernovae: The deflagration-to-detonation transition scenario"
Wright, Warren P.; Nagaraj, Gautam; Kneller, James P.; Scholberg, Kate; Seitenzahl, Ivo R.
Physical Review D, Volume 94, id.025026 (2016)
https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016PhRvD..94b5026W/abstract

There are 30 snapshots in time and for each snapshot there are 8 lines of sight through the explosion plus the no-oscillations case. Both mass orderings are considered. The format of each data file is the SNOwGLoBES format


The GCD model is described in 
"Neutrinos from type Ia supernovae: The gravitationally confined detonation scenario"
Wright, Warren P.; Kneller, James P.; Ohlmann, Sebastian T.; RÃ¶pke, Friedrich K.; Scholberg, Kate; Seitenzahl, Ivo R.
Physical Review D, Volume 95, id.043006 (2017)
https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017PhRvD..95d3006W/abstract

There are 64 snapshots in time and for each snapshot there are 10 lines of sight through the explosion plus the no-oscillations case. Both mass orderings are considered. The format of each data file is the SNOwGLoBES format
